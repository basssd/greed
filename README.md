# GREED

Greed is a really old, terminal based game.  
For more information see https://packages.debian.org/sid/games/greed et al.

Wanted to get my fingers wet with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), so here's my JavaScript interpretation.  
(frontend only, no backend needed, lot of room for improvements)

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn run lint
```
